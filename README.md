an isometric microtonal keyboard aiming to recreate Lumatone on ios devices

! UI only tested for iPad Gen 9, which i own

 # Features
 
 - a keyboard that looks like Lumatone
  + not pressure sensitive due to hardware restriction
  + touch between the keys to play multiple notes with one finger
  + press the lock button to lock/unlock the keyboard. the keyboard is only playable when 'locked'
 
 - pitchbend and velocity slider that affect all notes
 
 - choose presets from the built-in soundfont
 
 - choose between 4 built-in mappings, three for 12edo (Harmonic Table, Bosanquet-Wilson and Wicki-Hayden) and one for 31edo (Bosanquet-Wilson 31)
 
 # Planned
 
 - load soundfont from file
 
 - load Lumatone keymap from file(.ltn)
 
 - prettier gui
 
 - new infinite hexagonal layout, classic piano layout and a layout picker
